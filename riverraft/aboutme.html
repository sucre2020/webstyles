</body> <p> Hello. This is a brief introduction of myself. My name is Efita but my friends call me Sucre or Etta, the latter is my middle name. 
I am a native of a small island known as Bakassi in Cross River state, Nigeria, but currently, I reside in Port Harcourt, Rivers state. </p>
  
  <p> Coming from an island / a riverine area, I do swim and go fishing whenever I visit home. Additional, this year makes it 10 years since 
Jesus Christ found me, I am so grateful to those faithful missionaries, and I've never regretted the decision to be a member of The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. </p>
  
  <p> Currently, I work in the private sector, I specialize in surveillance and evaluation, and I'm pursuing a degree in Applied Technology, 
I beleive you'll agree with me that Technology makes our job easy, so I hope to specialize in Cyber Security one day. </p>
  
  <p> I'm a very busy person, I work more than 40 hours a week, and I school as well. However, when I'm free, I love to play or watch football, 
go hiking, play video games, sit-out with friends, take a short trip to somewhere I seldom visit or have never visited before, etc., 
I just love adventures. </p>
  
  <p> Some other things you should know about me, I love listening to music and meeting people, I have an open mind so I believe there's always 
something to learn about or from each other, you never can tell. I'm always willing to collaborate, so if anyone wants to work with me on any 
assignments, etc., you are welcome to contact me. Thank you for looking at my web page. </p>
